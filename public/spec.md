## password app

make a password manager

### Steps


### stuff to think about


### future add-ons

1. random password generator!!
2. multi-platform support?
3. two factor authentication?
4. master key + account key to be able to do anything with the data stored inside the vault.


### stuff to do
<!-- 1. save email to DB -->
<!-- 2. app.get to get data of a specific user from database -->
<!-- 3. ng-repeat to specific data to display on page -->
<!-- 3. User.update encrypted stuff in /data
  a. uncomment .update code and test
  b. make else statement that saves when no user is matched -->
<!-- 4. figure out ng-show -->
<!-- 5. break out create account and unlock -->

1. make invalid email show on page
2. add new data for existing user
3. when create button is hit and email already exists, showForm should not show up
4. bad decrypt error - show on page when wrong key is provided
5. error when a user exists and unlock is clicked, but logins in db is none.
