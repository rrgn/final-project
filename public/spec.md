## password app

make a password manager

### Steps
1. get crypto working on node, read up on express.
2. start building ui.
3. backend API. (user adds a login account for a website. Once retrieved, all the user's account will be displayed on the page)
4. master password required to make any changes.


### stuff to think about

1. do I need both md5 and bcrypt?
2. how secure is hashing only the master password and all the other passwords entered into the manager.
3. how to clear clipboard.
4. how to clear memory.
5. don't store secret in database.

### future add-ons

1. random password generator!!
2. multi-platform support?
3. two factor authentication?
4. master key + account key to be able to do anything with the data stored inside the vault.


### stuff to do
<!-- 1. save email to DB -->
2. app.get to get data of a specific user from database
3. ng-repeat to display on page
4. figure out ng-show
5. break out create account and unlock
6. make invalid email show on page
